// Package usagerefresh keeps Claude Code's usage cache from going stale.
//
// The model-scoped weekly limit and the official overage figures live only in
// ~/.claude.json under cachedUsageUtilization — the status-line payload carries
// neither. That branch is written by exactly one thing: Claude Code's /usage
// screen. On a machine where nobody opens /usage it is absent entirely, and
// where somebody once did it freezes at that moment (measured: a snapshot three
// hours old while the file itself was rewritten five times for other reasons).
//
// So we run the screen ourselves, headless:
//
//	claude -p "/usage" --no-session-persistence
//
// Measured properties (Claude Code 2.1.227): ~4.5 s wall clock, no model tokens
// spent — the transcript holds no assistant turn, only the local slash command
// and its network call for the limits — and with the flag no session file is
// left behind. Claude Code itself refuses to rewrite the cache more than once
// every five minutes, which is why the TTL here sits just past that number:
// asking more often burns processes for a file that will not change.
//
// The call is fire-and-forget: rendering a status line has a ~5 ms budget and
// this takes a thousand times that, so the process is detached and never waited
// on. Whatever it writes is picked up by a later render.
